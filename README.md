Error Handling: Try-catch, error objects.
Modules: Import/export, organizing code.

### Day 11-14: Project and Practice

## Week 3: Introduction to React

### Day 15-17: React Basics

Build a full-fledged React application (e.g., a task manager, a blog).
Deploy the app on a platform like Netlify or Vercel.

# Consistency: 
Dedicate at least 3-4 hours daily. Consistent practice and project-building are key.
